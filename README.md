## Synopsis

A few different scripts that I've put together over the last couple of years that work with Tenable's SecurityCenter.  This scripts are by no means perfect but they should offer a decent starting point.

## Brief Description of Scripts

`auto_sc_config.py` - Essentially, you fill in the variables at the bottom of the page and then run the script.  The script will go through all of the installation prompts for you.

`sc_delete_assets.py` - A quick script thrown together that deletes all assets manageable by the current user.

`sc_delete_scan_results.py` - This script will delete all scan results.  Running this script as 'admin' will delete **ALL** scan results manageable by the admin user.

`sc_api_template.py` - A quick SecurityCenter API Template written in Python 3 that works on the latest release of SecurityCenter (as of this writing that is 5.5).  I've left some samples coded in just for reference.
