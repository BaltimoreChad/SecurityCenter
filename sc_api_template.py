# Description: SecurityCenter 5 API Template.              #

# **DISCLAIMER**                                           #
# This script was designed for SecurityCenter 5.x using    #
# Python 3.x.  Please make sure all variables at the       #
# bottom of this script are filled in prior to running.    #
#                                                          #
#                                                          #
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:                                    #
# This script uses 'requests' and 'urllib3', please make   #
# sure those are installed on your system. You can install #
# these using pip.  To install pip, download and run this  #
# script: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py             #
# Once pip has been installed, run:                        #
# pip3 install requests                                    #
#                                                          #
# This script is a shell of a Python 3 SecurityCenter API  #
# script.  It is up to you, the user, to create you own    #
# functions from here.  This should handle any request you #
# come across in the API.  I've left one function in the   #
# script, that is currently commented out, for reference.  #
# Uncomment the get_assets function to retrieve the asset  #
# IDs for all manageable assets for the current user.      #
#                                                          #
# 1. Fill in all variables listed below (currently the     #
# variables are set with dummy values).                    #
# 2. Use Firebug or some other method and create your      #
# own API functions.                                       #
# 3. For some examples, check out my github:               #
